# Strings and Arrays
A collection of exercises involving strings and arrays.

## String Compression - compress_test.rb

Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of
repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become
a2b1c5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original
string, your method should return the original string.


## Space Replacer - replace_test.rb

Write a method that will replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. This method
will not replace any trailing spaces with %20.



## Matrix Rotator - rotator_test.rb

Write a method that will take an NxN matrix of numbers and rotate it 90 degrees
clockwise.
